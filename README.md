# Portfolio-Analysis

## Perform Quantitative Analysis
Analyze the data to determine if any of the portfolios outperform the stock market (that is, the S&P 500). Specifically, you will do a performance analysis and a risk analysis, and then calculate rolling statistics and Sharpe ratios.

### Performance Analysis
Calculate and plot daily returns of all portfolios.

Calculate and plot cumulative returns for all portfolios. Does any portfolio outperform the S&P 500?

### Risk Analysis
Create a box plot for each of the returns.

Calculate the standard deviation for each portfolio.

Determine which portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500.

Calculate the annualized standard deviation.

### Rolling Statistics
Calculate and plot the rolling standard deviation for all portfolios, using a 21-day window.

Calculate and plot the correlation between each stock to determine which portfolios mimic the S&P 500.

Choose one portfolio, then calculate and plot the 60-day rolling beta between that portfolio and the S&P 500.

### Rolling Statistics Challenge: Exponentially Weighted Average
An alternative method to calculate a rolling window is to find the exponentially weighted moving average. This is like a moving window average, but it assigns greater importance to more recent observations. Try calculating the ewmLinks to an external site. with a 21-day half-life.

### Sharpe Ratios
Investment managers and their institutional investors look at the return-to-risk ratio, not just the returns. After all, if you have two portfolios that each offer a 10% return, yet one is lower risk, you would invest in the lower-risk portfolio, right? Follow these steps:

Using the daily returns, calculate the Sharpe ratios and visualize them in a bar plot.

Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.

### Create a Custom Portfolio
Use Google SheetsLinks to an external site. and its built-in GOOGLEFINANCE function to choose 3â€“5 stocks for your portfolio.

Download the data as CSV files and calculate the portfolio returns.

Calculate the weighted returns for your portfolio, assuming equal number of shares per stock.

Add your portfolio returns to the DataFrame with the other portfolios.

Run the following analyses:

Calculate the annualized standard deviation.
Calculate and plot the rolling standard deviation with a 21-day window.
Calculate and plot the correlation.
Calculate and plot beta for your portfolio compared to the S&P 60 TSX.
Calculate the Sharpe ratios and generate a bar plot.
How does your portfolio perform?
